# Drachenwald Company of Archers

The Company is designed to promote archery within the Kingdom of Drachenwald. The company run Kingdom wide competitions and tracks the scores of archers all over the Kingdom so that they can be recognised as their skills improve. It has been a pleasant surprise to many an archer to read in announcements or hear in Court that they have achieved a new rank with the Company of Archers! 

They are also responsible for the education and training of archers, and for continuing historical research into archery methods, equipment and technologies.

The Captain General of Archers is the head of the Company and represents the Company before the Crown, and reviews and amends a set of rules for the Company as needed.

# Membership

# Ranks

Within the Drachenwald Company of Archers, there are the five ranks: Companion, Archer, Yeoman, Master Archer and Grand Master Archer. Once you have achieved a rank within the Company of Archers, it is permanent. Subsequent scores will not set you back in the rankings. 

* Companion: To become a Companion, an archer must complete three shoots within three calendar years. These shoots must be one of the official Kingdom rounds as set out in the Kingdom of Drachenwald Target Archery handbook. Two results per official SCA event or practice may be submitted.
* Archer, Yeoman & Master: In addition to the requirements of a companion, three scores must be at or above specific scores. These are detailed in the Company of Archers [Rules and Ranks document]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link offices/archery-thrown-marshal/files/dca-overview-ranks.pdf %}) (and you can see the badges you learn for each rank too.)
* Grand Master Archer: The purpose of the rank of Grand Master is to promote excellence in all aspects of period archery, not just attaining high scores. New Grand Masters will be invited to join the rank following a poll of existing Grand Masters. Grand Masters, if not already an authoring archery marshal, will be made one. This grants them the right to authorise new Archery and Thrown Weapons Marshals.
