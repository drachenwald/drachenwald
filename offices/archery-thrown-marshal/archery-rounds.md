# Official Competitions and Practices
Archery events may include any form of safe competition you can imagine, in keeping with the overall spirit of recreating medieval archery. Many forms have been used in the Society over the years.  Many authentic and creative styles of competitions have developed into standard shoots within the Society.

Only scores from official SCA events or practices may be submitted for Kingdom or Inter-Kingdom competitions or membership in the Drachenwald Company of Archers. 
For a practice to qualify as an official SCA practice, it must be approved by the local Seneschal and run by an SCA Target Archery Marshal. It must be open to all members of the SCA without requiring membership in any other organisation or payment of any fees, barring venue hire.
In the Drachenwald archery handbook, you will find the rules for Drachenwald's official competitions. ([Signed PDF version]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link offices/archery-thrown-marshal/files/drachenwald_target_archery_handbook_0.pdf %}))

The [archery round quick reference]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link offices/archery-thrown-marshal/files/archery-round-quick-reference.pdf %}) (PDF) provides a quick reminder of arrow counts, distances, and ranking scores for the common competition formats in Drachenwald.

These spreadsheets help in recording and submitting competition scores. Print the sheets for use during competitions. The spreadsheets automatically calculate archers' totals and ranking levels for each archer. Please be very careful to spell the name correctly and also indicate which shire the archer belongs to.
