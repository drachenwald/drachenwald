Do you want to become the next Robin Hood, Katniss Everdeen, Merida or Legolas with a bow and arrows, or throw axes, spears or knives? Then come join the Drachenwald Archery & Thrown Weapons community. Our activities are open to participants of all ages, and no previous experience is required.

# Drachenwald Company of Archers
The Company is designed to promote archery within the Kingdom of Drachenwald. The company runs Kingdom-wide competitions and tracks archers' scores, so they can be recognised as their skills improve. To find out more, check out the [Drachenwald Company of Archers page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link offices/archery-thrown-marshal/dw-company-of-archers.md %})

# Marshal Handbooks
We take safety seriously. 'Authorisation' refers to a person who wants to become a marshal, passing knowledge and practical tests to gain their marshalling warrant: a bit like taking a driving test before getting your license. 

* [Society-wide Target Archery and Thrown Weapons Marshal´s Handbook (2 documents)](https://www.sca.org/resources/document-library/#target-archery) provides a baseline of equipment guidance and range safety for archery marshals within the Society.

* [Drachenwald archery marshal's handbook]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link offices/archery-thrown-marshal/archery-policy.md %}), explaining safety rules, equipment guidelines and how to run tournaments within Drachenwald. ([Signed PDF version]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link offices/archery-thrown-marshal/files/drachenwald_target_archery_handbook_0.pdf %}))

* The [marshal training guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link offices/archery-thrown-marshal/archery-marshal-training.md %}) is an aid for marshals when supervising and teaching marshals in training.
