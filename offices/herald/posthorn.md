title: Correcting the Order of Precedence
excerpt: Send a correction to help keep kingdom records accurate

__Too long; didn't read:__  The Posthorn Herald keeps track of the awards that the royals give out in an [Order of Precedence](http://op.drachenwald.sca.org/). If you spot a mistake, here's how to help fix it.
{: .notice--primary}

The Crown decides who to recognise based on recommendations from the people of Drachenwald. You can email their Majesties, or [send a recommendation via a form online](http://op.drachenwald.sca.org/recommend).

Drachenwald's [Posthorn Herald](mailto:posthorn@drachenwald.sca.org) (posthorn@drachenwald.sca.org) is responsible for keeping the order of precedence up to date.

## Order of Precedence

Award information goes into the Order of Precedence (OP, or 'oh-pee'). Each kingdom keeps its own records, and [ours is kept in a searchable online database](http://op.drachenwald.sca.org/). Using the OP, you can look up:
- all the awards a person has received
- all the people who have ever received a particular award
- the awards given by a particular king and queen, or prince and princess
- the 'order of march', which is the way you'd queue everyone in Drachenwald up from the newest arrival to the highest ranking Crusty Old Peer â„¢

The OP forms part of our kingdom and principality history; you can see what happened at court at a given event, and track the official recognitions given to the populace.

Because many people have passed through our kingdom, it also holds records of many other kingdoms' awards, so you can see where people have served and played outside Drachenwald.

The most frequent use of the order of precedence database is to check who has what.

Before you write a recommendation to their Highnesses or to their Majesties, start by checking the OP, to see if the person you're recommending already has the award. If it's not listed, then you can start your message to the coronet or crown.

## Submit a correction

Like medieval heralds, heralds and their records aren't perfect. Sometimes the court herald doesn't turn in the report right away; sometimes a planned award is delayed, or the recipient doesn't attend the event as expected.

### What might need changing?

* a **mistake** to an award listed in the order of precedence: wrong date, wrong award, spelling error, missing modern name, wrong modern name, change in primary SCA name, change in region of residence. Please email a correction to Posthorn explaining what needs changing.

* a **missing award** which someone received **within Drachenwald** : please send a copy of the court report (from the Dragon's Tale), indicating which award was missed, or a photo of the scroll, to Posthorn. If you cannot find a court report, it's possible the court was not reported correctly. Check with the royals, or the court herald, from that court.

* **missing award(s)** which someone received in **another kingdom**: please send the person's name, and a link to the order of precedence for the kingdom. New arrivals to Drachenwald are welcome to tell us about themselves!

* a **heraldic device** to add the [Drachenwald
Armorial](https://op.drachenwald.sca.org/armorial) by sending an email to posthorn@drachenwald.sca.org with your device attached matching the device requirements below.

* something else not listed: please email Posthorn to explain
