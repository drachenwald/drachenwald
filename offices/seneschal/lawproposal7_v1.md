# Law Proposals for Curia 18 March 2025 and 05 April 2025

Their Majesties Æiríkr and Jacquelyna give notice that they will hold an **online Curia on Tuesday March 18th 2025 at 19:00 CET, and an in-person Curia on Saturday April 5th at Spring Crown tournament in Aarnimetsä** (exact time to be confirmed).

The agenda is the same for both Curia, to review five items of business: one item of old business regarding baronies within principalities, one new item to name the Kingdom Chatelaine as a Great Officer, one new item to be consistent with the old business item, and two new items of business to clarify where the responsibility lies to confirm local officers and to ensure that all award information gets sent to the Posthorn Herald.

These proposed changes are being put before the Curia for discussion. The outcome of that discussion may be that any of the proposed changes may be rejected or altered before being implemented into Kingdom law.

All Great Officers of the Kingdom should make every effort to attend both Curia meetings. If Great Officers are unable to do so, they may send a designated representative, or make their comments known to the Crown and Kingdom Seneschal in writing, prior to the day of the Curia. Members of the populace may also send comments in writing to the Crown (crown@drachenwald.sca.org) and Kingdom Seneschal (seneschal@drachenwald.sca.org) in advance of the meetings.


# Old Business: Proposal for moving responsibility regarding baronies within a principality from Crown to Coronet
## Reasoning
The burdens of the Crown are many. This proposal moves the responsibilities for those baronies that are within a Principality, from the Crown to the Coronet, as the Coronet is already responsible for their regions.

## Proposed law text
6.05 Territorial Baronies

6.05.1 While the Corpora provide for the basic terms on how territorial baronies are established, Drachenwald has the following extra requirements:

6.05.1.2 The petitioning branch must have a sustained record of activities, including the hosting of Principality or Kingdom-wide events.

6.05.2 The rulership of a Baronial fief shall be awarded by the Crown **or Coronet** upon petition by the members of the Barony in question.

6.05.3 When a Barony is left without at least one Baronial ruler the following procedures are in effect:

6.05.3.1 The outgoing Baronial ruler(s) shall appoint a Vicar as a temporary replacement. If this does not occur within ten days of the Baronial ruler(s) departure, the Crown **or Coronet** will appoint a Vicar. The Vicar shall hold no baronial office.

6.05.3.2 Within ninety days of the naming of the Vicar, the membership shall be polled to determine the future of the branch; to remain as a Barony, to change to non-baronial branch status, or dissolve the branch. This polling will be conducted by the Vicar and the Baronial Officers under the supervision of the Kingdom **or Principality** Seneschal. The results of this polling are due to the Crown **or Coronet** within thirty days of the poll being taken.

6.05.3.2.1 If the Barony members wish to dissolve the branch or change to non-baronial status, the Baronial Seneschal will coordinate with the Kingdom **or Principality** Seneschal on the necessary communications with the Society Seneschal, or the Board of Directors through the Society Seneschal. The Vicar shall retire at the end of the transition period.

6.05.3.2.2 If the Barony members wish to remain a Barony, they must select Baronial ruler(s). The recommendation process must occur within one year from when the Vicar was named. At this time the group may send a petition to the Crown **or Coronet** naming its candidates (either an individual or a couple). The Vicar retires once the proposed Baronial rulership is approved by the Crown **or Coronet**.

6.05.3.2.2.1 If the Barony members are unable to select a Baronial ruler(s) in the time allowed, the members will be polled to select a non-baronial branch status. The branch may not apply for Baronial status for at least two years. The Vicar retires on the day of the polling.

6.05.4 At any time the members of a Barony may petition the Crown **or Coronet** for the appointment of a Baronial ruler Baron/Baroness If a Barony has only a single Baronial ruler, the members of the Barony may petition the Crown **or Coronet** for the appointment of an additional Baronial ruler to rule with its current Baronial ruler.

6.05.5 In the event that the members of the Barony in question wish to remove one or both Baronial rulers, they must first seek arbitration through the grievance procedure outlined in 12.02.2.

6.05.5.1 If it is the finding of the arbitrators that the best solution to the difficulties is the removal or suspension of either or both Baronial rulers, the membership shall submit a petition to that effect, signed by at least two-thirds of the members, to the Crown **or Coronet**. The arbitrators will submit a report of their findings as specified in Drachenwald Law.

6.05.6 Baronial rulers have the right to give non-armigerous awards and positions of honour.

6.05.7 Baronial rulers hold their Baronies in Fealty to the Crown<b>, or to the Coronet if the Barony is within a Principality</b>. ~~This fealty must be presented at Coronation. If unable to attend, one or both of the Baronial rulers will provide fealty to the Crowns prior to the day scheduled for Coronation.~~ **They must present this fealty at Coronation or Investiture, as appropriate, either in person, through an envoy, or in writing.**

6.05.8 The length of a single term for a Baronial ruler is a maximum of two years.

Should the Baronial rulers be victorious in the Crown or Coronet Tournament, the Vicar assumes responsibility for the Barony immediately. The Vicar must conduct a polling for the new Baronial rulers within 90 days.

# 3. Proposal for clarification of where the responsibility lies to appoint and confirm local officers

# 4. Proposal for clarification of the responsibility to get awards registered in the Order of Precedence database
## Reasoning
The purpose of this proposal is to minimize frustration over missing awards in the online Order of Precedence, and to avoid wasting the time and resources of scribes and royals that unknowingly plan to give out awards that a recipient has already received. This proposal affects sections 2.02.6 and 5.06.2.3, and adds new sections 5.06.2.6, 6.01.5, and 6.05.6.1.

## Formatting
In the law text below, added text is marked with **bold** and removed text is marked with ~~strikethrough~~.

**5.06.2.3** Shall set up and maintain a Kingdom Order of Precedence and shall be responsible for having the Order of Precedence updated <b>with all awards given in all royal courts of Drachenwald, including the Kingdom's Principality and Baronial courts. The database for the Order of Precedence (OP) is an online tool that aids the populace when sending in award recommendations and it aids all of Drachenwald's royalty when deciding which awards to give out.
