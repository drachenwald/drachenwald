- The finals will be fought as best out of five.
- If a fighter runs into the edge of the list field causing a hold three times, they will be considered to have fled the field and thus it will count as a loss.
- Pushing an opponent into the edge of the list cannot be used as a means to gain a victory in a bout.
- Double kills will be considered a loss for both parties and will only be re-fought if needed to determine a victor.

We wish all participants the best of luck!
