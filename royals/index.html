            Her Majesty is the first-born of a wealthy and noble family,
            that allowed Her to study and travel the world,
            indulging Her interests in learning about new cultures and languages.
            These interests brought Her from the isles of Insulae Draconis
            to the shores of Nordmark where She fell in love and is living happily ever after.
